deleting tasks. Additionally, users will have the flexibility to sort tasks based on priority and mark them as complete.

their tasks according to specific days, providing a structured approach to task management. By incorporating this calendar functionality,
users can easily allocate tasks to specific days and ensure they stay on top of their responsibilities.
